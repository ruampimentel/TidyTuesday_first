# Load the weekly Data

Download the weekly data and make available in the `tt` object.

```{r Load}

tt <- tt_load("2021-02-09")

```


# Readme

Take a look at the readme for the weekly data to get insight on the dataset.
This includes a data dictionary, source, and a link to an article on the data.

```{r Readme, eval = interactive()}

tt 
```


# Glimpse Data

Take an initial look at the format of the data available.

```{r Glimpse}

tt %>% 
  map(glimpse)

```

# Wrangle

Explore the data and process it into a nice format for plotting! Access each dataset by name by using a dollarsign after the `tt` object and then the name of the data set.

```{r Wrangle}

lifetime_earn <- tt$lifetime_earn

student_debt <- tt$student_debt

student_debt %>%
  count(year)

retirement <- tt$retirement
retirement %>% 
  count(year)

home_owner <- tt$home_owner
home_owner %>% 
  count(year)

race_wealth <- tt$race_wealth
race_wealth %>% 
  count(year, type)
